# Multiplex is now OpenSourced!
> Multiplex was a [Discord](https://discord.com) Bot by [Ricky](https://github.com/RickyDana06). Multiplex was made in a simplified Discord.JS package called [DB-Script](https://www.db-script.xyz).

## Hosting
We suggest you host on a VPS or [Replit](https://replit.com). But you can host it anywhere that supports `.js` files!

## Packages and more
THe following are required for Multiplex to work
```
    "discord.js": "^12.2.0", //MUST BE 12.2.O!!!
    "discordbot-script": "^2.5.0", //This can be updated to latest, But some commands may break!
```

## .env
Create a file called `.env`, Input the following
```
TOKEN=token here // This is the bot token. keep it private!
PREFIX1=$getServerVar[prefix] // You can change this to whatever, but it's suggested to keep the way it is!
PREFIX2=<@bot id> // This is so PC users can ping the bot as a prefix
PREFIX3=<@!bot id> // This is so mobile users can ping the bot as a prefix
```

## Reminders
Bot has been unmaintained for about several months now , Many updates are needed. If you spot a **MAJOR** bug please open an [Issue](https://github.com/Ricky-JS/MultiPlex/issues)!

## Credit
Please make sure to credit the Developer, Ricky, when using this bots source. He worked really hard on it!
